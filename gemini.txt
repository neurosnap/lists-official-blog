I'm excited to announce we have launch gemini support!

It was always our goal to launch the product with gemini support.  Gemini is a new kind of protocol that emphasizes reading and writing documents.  It's the perfect blend of readability and ease-of-use.
If you haven't downloaded a gemini client, I highly recommend it.
