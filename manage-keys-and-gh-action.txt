=: title Manage your keys and a github action
=: description Two new quality of life features to lists.sh

I'm excited to announce a couple of new features to lists.sh.

# Manage your keys from the CMS

Now users can add multiple keys for a single account.  Manage your keys by logging into our CMS: `ssh <username>@lists.sh`.Then select "Manage keys."

## Features

You can add new keys to your account
You can delete keys from your account
If you delete all of your keys it will delete your account along with all its posts

# New github action to publish posts

Now you can publish changes to your blog via a github action.

# Closing thoughts

I've been having a blast hacking on this project and I'm delighted by all the lists being created here.  I have a couple more features on the roadmap that I want to add shortly.
Once those are finished I plan on focusing on community building.
